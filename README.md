# on_the_way_to_selfrespect

Unorganized activities that many people call 'fun' (like hanging out, chatroom, video games, etc..) do not always promise that participants will learn important life lessons like self-esteem and self-respect. Constantly engaging in unorganized activities without learning self-respect can create a vicious cycle where individuals do not know what self-respect is, nor understand how to treat themselves with respect and others with respect.

Self-respect is knowing that one can always "do better", learn, and achieve the necessary things in life to live in society responsibily and happily. 

Dictionary citations: 
  - Dictionary.com : "proper esteem or regard for the dignity of one's character."
  
When one thinks that they can not "do better", they think that they are a victim. Many "victim belivers" think that they deserve or it is allowable to use/hurt others that are "doing better in life" in order for them to "survive" (ie: acheive better life success). "Victim belivers" (ie: people with low self-respect/esteem) do not have confidence/belief in their ownselves, which is the definition of self-respect (to have belief and confidence in one's self), such that they can do better or acheive success all by themselves. 

Thus, "Victim belivers"/low self-respect/esteem people disrespect themselves and they disrespect others. Please learn about self-respect such that everyone can suceed in life together, and the world can be a less violent place.

This memorization game is to help people to start to think about self-respect.
